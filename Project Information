Project Description:
--------------------
Education is Freedom is looking for a user driven (student/company) web-based intern placement system to help match students to internship opportunities,
companies, and roles that would best suite them. This process should take should consider criteria defined by EIF and interests defined by students.

Q&A:
----------------------------------------------------------
What are the EIF admin requirements?


Are we allowed to alter the application criteria?
YES.

How are you going to gauge the 95% satisfaction criteria?
2 or 3 questions asking about satisfaction

Is the application largely natural language?

What kinds of people will be using this web app?

How does the data come in?
Online application, information from either a spreadsheet/database

Leading causes for dissatisfaction:
unwanted company, uncool company

Why would we need to use resumes?
Last resort? lol

*******************
* Considerations: *
*******************
- What happens if a student turns down a job?
  they get matched up in the next iteration
- What happens if a company has no student match?
  Go to interests pool
- Highly sought after vs. less desirable internships

Requirements:
-------------
- Web App
- desktop/mobile friendly (responsive web app)
- Security considerations
- ~500 companies
- ~1000 students

Entire matching process:
------------------------
front end interface -> profile creation -> INTERN/COMPANY MATCH (MVP) -> intern management

Current process for intern/company match:
-----------------------------------------
1.
  a. students pick 5 jobs they want to interview w/ from company job descriptions
  b. companies review resumes and interests from student profile, pick 1-x students to interview
     can leave blanks (students don't have to fill all the ranks)

2. Scheduling 6 15 min interviews for 2 interviewers per company
   3 sessions of 6 interviews total
   sessions separated by schools

3. Students rank job preferences 1-5
   Companies rank students 1-x
   Check for matches on multiple levels
   Not all the students will get a jobs

4. Report
   output results, include student/company ranking
   automated offer letter

ULTIMATE GOAL: Most Best Fit/Best Match, only one match
